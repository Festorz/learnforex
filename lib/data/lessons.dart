Quite simply, it’s the global financial market that allows one to trade currencies.

If you think one currency will be stronger versus the other, and you end up correct, then you can make a profit.

Once upon a time, before a global pandemic happened, people could actually get on airplanes and travel internationally.

If you’ve ever traveled to another country, you usually had to find a currency exchange booth at the airport, and then exchange the money you have in your wallet into the currency of the country you are visiting.''',

    description: '''The simple answer is MONEY. Specifically, currencies.

Because you’re not buying anything physical, forex trading can be confusing so we’ll use a simple (but imperfect) analogy to help explain.

Think of buying a currency as buying a share in a particular country, kinda like buying shares in a company.

The price of the currency is usually a direct reflection of the market’s opinion on the current and future health of its respective economy.

In forex trading, when you buy, say, the Japanese yen, you are basically buying a “share” in the Japanese economy.

    description: '''What is forex trading?

Forex trading is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another.

Currencies are traded through a “forex broker” or “CFD provider” and are traded in pairs. Currencies are quoted in relation to another currency.

For example, the euro and the U.S. dollar (EUR/USD) or the British pound and the Japanese yen (GBP/JPY).

When you trade in the forex market, you buy or sell in currency pairs.

Buying and Selling in Currency Pairs

Imagine each currency pair constantly in a “tug of war” with each currency on its own side of the rope.

An exchange rate is the relative price of two currencies from two different countries.

Exchange rates fluctuate based on which currency is stronger at the moment.

There are three categories of currency pairs:

    The “majors“
    The “crosses“
    The “exotics“

The major currency pairs always include the U.S. dollar.

Cross-currency pairs do NOT include the U.S. dollar. Crosses that involve any of the major currencies are also known as ” minors”.

Exotic currency pairs consist of one major currency and one currency from an emerging market (EM).''',

        '''The bulk of forex trading takes place on what’s called the “interbank market“.

Unlike other financial markets like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or London Stock Exchange (LSE), the forex market has neither a physical location nor a central exchange.

The forex market is considered an over-the-counter (OTC) market due to the fact that the entire market is run electronically, within a network of banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), continuously over a 24-hour period.

This means that the FX market is spread all over the globe with no central location.

Trades can take place anywhere as long as you have an internet connection!

Forex Interbank Network

The forex OTC market is by far the biggest and most popular financial market in the world.

And it is traded globally by a large number of individuals and organizations.

In an OTC market, participants can be picky and determine who they want to trade with depending on trading conditions, the attractiveness of prices, and the reputation of the trading counterparty (the other party who takes the opposite side of your trade).

    description: '''How do people participate in the forex market?

So far, you’ve learned what the forex market is, how big it is, the different types of currencies and how they are sold in pairs.

But how do you trade forex?

Let’s now take a look at how to participate as a trader.
How to Trade Forex

Because forex is so awesome, traders came up with a number of different ways to invest or speculate in currencies.

Among the financial instruments, the most popular ones are retail forex, spot FX, currency futures, currency options, currency exchange-traded funds (or ETFs), forex CFDs, and forex spread betting.

How to trade forex

It’s important to point out that we are covering the different ways that individual (“retail”) traders can trade FX.

Other financial instruments like FX swaps and forwards are not covered since they cater to institutional traders.

With that out of the way, let’s now discuss how you can partake in the world of forex.
Currency Futures

Futures are contracts to buy or sell a certain asset at a specified price on a future date (That’s why they’re called futures!).

A currency future is a contract that details the price at which a currency could be bought or sold and sets a specific date for the exchange.

Currency futures were created by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) way back in 1972 when bell-bottoms and platform boots were still in style.

Since futures contracts are standardized and traded on a centralized exchange, the market is very transparent and well-regulated.

This means that price and transaction information are readily available.

You can learn more about CME’s FX futures here.
Currency Options

An “option” is a financial instrument that gives the buyer the right or the option, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on the option’s expiration date.

If a trader “sold” an option, then he or she would be obliged to buy or sell an asset at a specific price at the expiration date.

Just like futures, options are also traded on an exchange, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the International Securities Exchange (ISE), or the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX).

However, the disadvantage in trading FX options is that market hours are limited for certain options and the liquidity is not nearly as great as the futures or spot market.
Currency ETFs

A currency ETF offers exposure to a single currency or basket of currencies.

Currency ETFs allow ordinary individuals to gain exposure to the forex market through a managed fund without the burdens of placing individual trades.

Currency ETFs can be used to speculate on forex, diversify a portfolio, or hedge against currency risks.

Here’s a list of the most popularly traded currency ETFs.

ETFs are created and managed by financial institutions that buy and hold currencies in a fund. They then offer shares of the fund to the public on an exchange allowing you to buy and trade these shares just like stocks.

Like currency options, the limitation in trading currency ETFs is that the market isn’t open 24 hours. Also, ETFs are subject to trading commissions and other transaction costs.
Spot FX

The spot FX market is an “off-exchange” market, also known as an over-the-counter (“OTC”) market.

The off-exchange forex market is a large, growing, and liquid financial market that operates 24 hours a day.

It is not a market in the traditional sense because there is no central trading location or “exchange”.

In an OTC market, a customer trades directly with a counterparty.

Unlike currency futures, ETFs, and (most) currency options, which are traded through centralized markets, spot FX are over-the-counter contracts (private agreements between two parties).

Most of the trading is conducted through electronic trading networks (or telephone).

The primary market for FX is the “interdealer” market where FX dealers trade with each other. A dealer is a financial intermediary that stands ready to buy or sell currencies at any time with its clients.

The interdealer market is also known as the “interbank” market due to the dominance of banks as FX dealers.

The interdealer market is only accessible to institutions that trade in large quantities and have a very high net worth.

This includes banks, insurance companies, pension funds, large corporations, and other large financial institutions manage the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates.

Physical Dleivery of CurrencyIn the spot FX market, an institutional trader is buying and selling an agreement or contract to make or take delivery of a currency.

A spot FX transaction is a bilateral (“between two parties”) agreement to physically exchange one currency against another currency.

This agreement is a contract. This means this spot contract is a binding obligation to buy or sell a certain amount of foreign currency at a price that is the “spot exchange rate” or the current exchange rate.

So if you buy EUR/USD on the spot market, you are trading a contract that specifies that you will receive a specific amount of euros in exchange for U.S dollars at an agreed-upon price (or exchange rate).

It’s important to point out that you are NOT trading the underlying currencies themselves, but a contract involving the underlying currencies.

Even though it’s called  “spot”, transactions aren’t exactly settled “on the spot”.

In reality, while a spot FX trade is done at the current market rate, the actual transaction is not settled until two business days after the trade date.

This is known as T+2 (“Today plus 2 business days”).

It means that delivery of what you buy or sell should be done within two working days and is referred to as the value date or delivery date.

For example, an institution buys EUR/USD in the spot FX market.

The trade opened and closed on Monday has a value date on Wednesday. This means that it’ll receive euros on Wednesday.

Not all currencies settle T+2 though. For example, USD/CAD, USD/TRY, USD/RUB and USD/PHP value date is T+1, meaning one business day going forward from today (T).

Trading in the actual spot forex market is NOT where retail traders trade though.
Retail Forex

There is a secondary OTC market that provides a way for retail (“poorer”) traders to participate in the forex market.

Access is granted by so-called  “forex trading providers“.

Forex trading providers trade in the primary OTC market on your behalf. They find the best available prices and then add a “markup” before displaying the prices on their trading platforms.

This is similar to how a retail store buys inventory from a wholesale market, adds a markup, and shows a “retail” price to their customers.

How to Make Money Trading Forex

What is forex trading?

The forex (also known as FX or foreign exchange) market refers to the global marketplace where banks, institutions, and individuals speculate on the exchange rate between fiat currencies.

The forex market is the largest financial market in the world.
How does forex trading work?

As a forex trader, you are speculating on whether one currency will rise or fall in price against another currency.

So “forex trading” can be defined as the process of speculating on currency prices to try and make a profit.

The value of a currency is influenced by economic, political, geopolitical events, and trade and financial flows.

Placing a trade in the foreign exchange market is simple.

The mechanics of a trade are very similar to those found in other financial markets (like the stock market), so if you have any experience in trading, you should be able to pick it up pretty quickly.

How To Make Money Trading Forex

And if you don’t, you’ll still be able to pick it up….as long as you finish School of Pipsology, our forex trading course!

The objective of forex trading is to exchange one currency for another in the expectation that the price will change.

More specifically, the currency you bought will increase in value compared to the one you sold.''',

    title: "Know When to Buy or Sell a Currency Pair",
    description:
        '''Forex trading involves trying to predict which currency will rise or fall versus another currency.

How do you know when to buy or sell a currency pair?

In the following examples, we are going to use a little fundamental analysis to help us decide whether to buy or sell a specific currency pair.

The supply and demand for a currency changes due to various economic factors, which drive currency exchange rates up and down.

Each currency belongs to a country (or region). So forex fundamental analysis focuses on the overall state of the country’s economy,  such as productivity, employment, manufacturing, international trade, and interest ratezzzzzzzz.

Wake up!

If you always fell asleep during your economics class or just flat-out skipped economics class, don’t worry!

We will cover fundamental analysis in a later lesson.

But right now, try to pretend you know what’s going on…
EUR/USD

In this example, the euro is the base currency and thus the “basis” for the buy/sell.

If you believe that the U.S. economy will continue to weaken, which is bad for the U.S. dollar, you would execute a BUY EUR/USD order.

By doing so, you have bought euros with the expectation that it will rise versus the U.S. dollar.

If you believe that the U.S. economy is strong and the euro will weaken against the U.S. dollar, you would execute a SELL EUR/USD order.

By doing so, you have sold euros with the expectation that it will fall versus the US dollar.

    title: " What is a Pip in Forex? ",
    image: 'https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/15144610/pip-cheat-sheet-forex.png',
    description: '''What’s a pip?

You’ve probably heard of the terms “pips,” “points“, “pipettes,” and “lots” thrown around, and now we’re going to explain what they are and show you how their values are calculated.

Here is where we’re going to do a little math. Just a little bit.

Learn About Pips in Forex

Take your time with this information, as it is required knowledge for all forex traders.

Don’t even think about trading until you are comfortable with pip values and calculating profit and loss.

What the heck is a Pip?

The unit of measurement to express the change in value between two currencies is called a “pip.”

If EUR/USD moves from 1.1050 to 1.1051, that .0001 USD rise in value is ONE PIP.

A pip is usually the last decimal place of a price quote.

Most pairs go out to 4 decimal places, but there are some exceptions like Japanese yen pairs (they go out to two decimal places).

For example, for EUR/USD, it is 0.0001, and for USD/JPY, it is 0.01.

Pip
What is a Pipette?

There are forex brokers that quote currency pairs beyond the standard “4 and 2” decimal places to “5 and 3” decimal places.

They are quoting FRACTIONAL PIPS, also called “points” or “pipettes.”

If the concept of a “pip” isn’t already confusing enough for the new forex trader, let’s try to make you even more confused and point out that a “point” or “pipette” or “fractional pip” is equal to a “tenth of a pip“.

For instance, if GBP/USD moves from 1.30542 to 1.30543, that .00001 USD move higher is ONE PIPETTE.

Pipette''',

      title: " What is a Lot in Forex? ",
      image:
          'https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/14171517/different-lot-types-babypips.png',
      description:
          '''Forex is commonly traded in specific amounts called lots, or basically the number of currency units you will buy or sell.

A “lot” is a unit measuring a transaction amount.

When you place orders on your trading platform, orders are placed in sizes quoted in lots.

It’s like an egg carton (or egg box in British English). When you buy eggs, you usually buy a carton (or box). One carton includes 12 eggs.

The standard size for a lot is 100,000 units of currency, and now, there are also mini, micro, and nano lot sizes that are 10,000, 1,000, and 100 units.

Some brokers show quantity in “lots”, while other brokers show the actual currency units.

As you may already know, the change in a currency value relative to another is measured in “pips,” which is a very, very small percentage of a unit of currency’s value.

To take advantage of this minute change in value, you need to trade large amounts of a particular currency in order to see any significant profit or loss.

Let’s assume we will be using a 100,000 unit (standard) lot size. We will now recalculate some examples to see how it affects the pip value.

    USD/JPY at an exchange rate of 119.80: (.01 / 119.80) x 100,000 =   \$8.34 per pip
    USD/CHF at an exchange rate of 1.4555: (.0001 / 1.4555) x 100,000 =   \$6.87 per pip

    title: " What is a Spread in Forex Trading?",
    image: 'https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/01/17000047/forex-spread.png',
    description:
        '''Forex brokers will quote you two different prices for a currency pair: the bid and ask price.

The “bid” is the price at which you can SELL the base currency.

The “ask” is the price at which you can BUY the base currency.

The difference between these two prices is known as the spread.

Also known as the “bid/ask spread“.

The spread is how “no commission” brokers make their money.

This spread is the fee for providing transaction immediacy. This is why the terms “transaction cost” and “bid-ask spread” are used interchangeably.

Instead of charging a separate fee for making a trade, the cost is built into the buy and sell price of the currency pair you want to trade.

From a business standpoint, this makes sense. The broker provides a service and has to make money somehow.

    They make money by selling the currency to you for more than they paid to buy it.
    And they also make money by buying the currency from you for less than they will receive when they sell it.
    This difference is called the spread.

It’s just like if you were trying to sell your old iPhone to a store that buys used iPhones. (A smartphone with only two rear cameras? Yuck!)

Price Spread

In order to make a profit, it will need to buy your iPhone at a price lower than the price it’ll sell it for.

If it can sell the iPhone for   \$500, then if it wants to make any money, the most it can buy from you is   \$499.

That difference of   \$1 is the spread.

So when a broker claims “zero commissions” or “no commission”, it’s misleading because while there is no separate commission fee, you still pay a commission.

It’s just built into the bid/ask spread!

    title: " Can You Get Rich By Trading Forex? ",
    description:
        '''Before we go any further, we are going to be 100% honest with you and tell you the following before you consider trading currencies:
1. All forex traders, and we do mean ALL traders, LOSE money on some trades.

Forex Is Not A Get Rich Quick Scheme!Ninety percent of traders lose money, largely due to lack of planning, training, discipline, not having a trading edge and having poor money management rules.

If you hate to lose or are a super perfectionist, you’ll also probably have a hard time adjusting to trading because all traders lose a trade at some point or another.

2. Trading forex is not for the unemployed, those on low incomes, are knee-deep in credit card debt or who can’t afford to pay their electricity bill or afford to eat.

Poor New Forex Trader

You should have at least   \$10,000 of trading capital (in a mini account) that you can afford to lose.

Don’t expect to start an account with a few hundred dollars and expect to become a gazillionaire.

The forex market is one of the most popular markets for speculation, due to its enormous size, liquidity, and the tendency for currencies to move in strong trends.

You would think traders all over the world would make a killing, but success has been limited to a very small percentage of traders.

The problem is that many traders come with the misguided hope of making a gazillion bucks, but in reality, they lack the discipline required for really learning the art of trading.

Most people usually lack the discipline to stick to a diet or to go to the gym three times a week.

If you can’t even do that, how do you think you’re going to succeed one of the most difficult, but financially rewarding, endeavors known to man (and woman)?

Short term trading IS NOT for amateurs, and it is rarely the path to “get rich quick”. You can’t make gigantic profits without taking gigantic risks.

A trading strategy that involves taking a massive degree of risk means suffering inconsistent trading performance and large losses.

A trader who does this probably doesn’t even have a trading strategy – unless you call gambling a trading strategy!
Forex Trading is NOT a Get-Rich-Quick Scheme

Forex trading is a SKILL that takes TIME to learn.

Skilled traders can and do make money in this field. However, like any other occupation or career, success doesn’t just happen overnight.

Forex trading isn’t a piece of cake (as some people would like you to believe).

Think about it, if it was, everyone trading would already be millionaires.

The truth is that even expert traders with years of experience still encounter periodic losses.

Drill this in your head: there are NO shortcuts to forex trading.

It takes lots and lots of PRACTICE and EXPERIENCE to master.

There is no substitute for hard work, deliberate practice, and diligence.

Practice trading on a DEMO ACCOUNT until you find a method that you know inside and out, and can comfortably execute objectively. Basically, find the way that works for you!!!

It’s time to learn about the different forex trading sessions.

Forex Trading Sessions

Yes, it is true that the forex market is open 24 hours a day, but that doesn’t mean it’s always active the entire day.

You can make money trading when the market moves up, and you can even make money when the market moves down.

BUT you will have a very difficult time trying to make money when the market doesn’t move at all.

And believe us, there will be times when the market is as still as the victims of Medusa.

Quiet Forex Sessions

This lesson will help determine when the best times of the day are to trade.
Forex Market Hours

Forex Market Hours

Before looking at the best times to trade, we must look at what a 24-hour day in the forex world looks like.

The forex market can be broken up into four major trading sessions: the Sydney session, the Tokyo session, the London session, and Trump’s favorite time to tweet (before he was banned), the New York session.

Historically, the forex market has three peak trading sessions.

Traders often focus on one of the three trading periods, rather than attempt to trade the markets 24 hours per day.

This is known as the “forex 3-session system“.

These sessions consist of the Asian, European, and North American sessions, which are also called Tokyo, London, and New York sessions.

Some traders prefer to differentiate sessions by names of the continent, other traders prefer to use the names of the cities.''',

What does this have to do with trading sessions?

Well, just like TV, “ratings” (a.k.a. liquidity) are at their highest when there are more people participating in the markets.

Forex Trading Session Overlaps

So when is the best time to trade forex?

Logically, you would think that this happens during the overlap between the two sessions.

If you thought that way, you’d only be half-right.

Let’s discuss some of the characteristics of the two overlap sessions to see why.
Tokyo – London Overlap

Tokyo-London Overlap

Liquidity during this session is pretty thin for a few reasons. Typically, there isn’t as much movement during the Asian session so, once the afternoon hits, it’s pretty much a snooze fest. Zzzzzz.

With European traders just starting to get into their offices, trading can be boring as liquidity dries up.

This would be an ideal time to take a chill pill, play some putt-putt golf, or look for potential trades to take for the London and New York sessions.''',

      title: " Best Days of the Week to Trade Forex ",
      description:
          '''So now we know that the London session is the busiest out of all the other sessions, but there are also certain days in the week where all the markets tend to show more movement.

Know the best days of the week to trade forex. 
Below is a chart of the average pip range for the major pairs for each day of the week:
As you can see from the chart above, it’s best to trade during the middle of the week, since this is when the most action happens.

Fridays are usually busy until 12:00 pm EST and then the market pretty much drops dead until it closes at 5:00 pm EST.

This means we only work half-days on Fridays.

The weekend always starts early! Yippee!

So based on all these, we’ve learned when the busiest and best days of the week to trade forex are.

The busiest times are usually the best times to trade since high volatility tends to present more opportunities.
Managing Yo Time Wisely

Unless you’re Edward Cullen, who does not sleep, there is no way you can trade all sessions. Even if you could, why would you?

While the forex market is open 24 hours daily, it doesn’t mean that action happens all the time!

Besides, sleep is an integral part of a healthy lifestyle!

You need sleep to recharge and have energy so that you can do even the most mundane tasks like mowing the lawn, talking to your spouse, taking the dog for a walk, or organizing your stamp collection.

You’ll definitely need your rest if you plan on becoming a hotshot currency trader.

Every trader should learn when to trade.

Actually, scratch that.

Every trader should know when to trade and when NOT to trade.

Knowing the optimal times you should trade and the times when you should sit out and just play some Fortnite instead.

Unless you play Fortnite a little too much already.

Fortnite Addiction

Here’s a quick cheat sheet of the best and worst times to trade:
Best Times to Trade:

    When two sessions are overlapping of course! These are also the times where major news events come out to potentially spark some volatility and directional movements.
    Make sure you bookmark the Market Hours cheat sheet to take note of the Opening and Closing times.
    You can also use our Forex Market Time Zone Converter which automatically displays which trading session(s) is open in your current local time.
    The European session tends to be the busiest out of the three.
    The middle of the week typically shows the most movement, as the pip range widens for most of the major currency pairs.

Worst Times to Trade:

    Sundays – everyone is sleeping or enjoying their weekend!
    Fridays – liquidity dies down during the latter part of the U.S. session.
    Holidays – everybody is taking a break.
    Major news events – you don’t want to get whipsawed!
    When you just broke up with your significant other because you chose forex trading over him or her. Wait until the next London session instead.

Can’t seem to trade during the optimal sessions? Don’t fret.

You can always be a swing or position trader. We’ll get back to that later.

  LessonModel(
    title: "Forex Market Structure",
    description:
        '''For the sake of comparison, let us first examine a market that most folks are probably very familiar with: the stock market.

This is how the structure of the stock market looks like:

Centralized Financial Market

By its very nature, the stock market tends to be very monopolistic. There is only one entity, one specialist that controls prices.

All trades must go through this specialist. Because of this, prices can easily be altered to benefit the specialist and not traders.

How does this happen?

In the stock market, the specialist is forced to fulfill the order of its clients. Now, let’s say the number of sellers suddenly exceeds the number of buyers.

The specialist, which is forced to fulfill the order of its clients, the sellers, in this case, is left with a bunch of stock that he cannot sell off to the buyer side.

In order to prevent this from happening, the specialist will simply widen the spread or increase the transaction cost to prevent sellers from entering the market.

In other words, the specialists can manipulate the quotes it is offering to accommodate their needs.
Trading Spot FX is Decentralized

Unlike in trading stocks or futures, you don’t need to go through a centralized exchange like the New York Stock Exchange with just one price.

In the forex market, there is no single price for a given currency at any time, which means quotes from different currency dealers vary.

Forex Market Structure

“So many choices! Awesome!”
This might be overwhelming at first, but this is what makes the forex market so freakin’ awesome!

The market is so huge and the competition between dealers is so fierce that you get the best deal almost every single time.

And tell me, who does not want that?

Also, one cool thing about forex trading is that you can do it anywhere. It’s just like trading Jordans or rare handbags.

You want that mint condition Air Jordan 4 Retro Eminem Encore 2017, so it is up to you to find the best deal out there.
The FX Ladder

Even though the forex market is decentralized, it isn’t pure and utter chaos!

The participants in the FX market can be organized into a ladder. To better understand what we mean, here is a neat illustration:

Forex Market Hierarchy

At the very top of the forex market ladder is the interbank market.

Composed of the largest banks in the world, the participants of this market trade directly with each other (“bilaterally”) or through voice or electronic brokers (such as EBS Market and Reuters Matching).

The competition between the two companies, EBS and Reuters (now rebranded as Refinitiv), is similar to Coke and Pepsi.

They are in a constant battle for clients and continually try to one-up each other for market share. While both companies offer most currency pairs, some currency pairs are more liquid on one than the other.

For the EBS platform, EUR/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF, and USD/CHF are more liquid.

Meanwhile, for the Reuters platform, GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, USD/CAD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD are more liquid.

All the banks that are part of the interbank market can see the rates that each other is offering, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that anyone can make deals at those prices.

Like in real life, the rates will be largely dependent on the established CREDIT relationship between the trading parties.

It’s like asking for a loan at your local bank. The better your credit standing and reputation with them, the better the interest rates and the larger loan you can get.

Next on the ladder are the hedge funds, corporations, retail market makers, and retail ECNs.

Since these institutions do not have tight credit relationships with the participants of the interbank market, they have to do their transactions via commercial banks.

This means that their rates are slightly higher and more expensive than those who are part of the interbank market.

At the very bottom of the ladder are non-professional traders known as retail traders.

It used to be very hard for us little people to engage in the forex market but thanks to the advent of the internet, electronic trading, and retail brokers, the difficult barriers to entry in forex trading have all been taken down.

This gave us the chance to play with those high up the ladder and poke them with a very long and cheap stick.

    title: " Forex Market Players ",
    description: '''

Now that you know the overall structure of the forex market, let’s delve in a little deeper to find out who exactly these people on the ladder are.

It is essential for you to understand the nature of the spot forex market and who are the main forex market players.

Let’s learn about the main players in the forex market, from the big-shot banks to the little guys at home in their pajamas.

Forex Market Players

Until the late 1990s, only the “big boys” could play this game.

The initial requirement was that you could trade only if you had about ten to fifty million bucks to start with. Chump change right?

Forex was originally intended to be used by bankers and large institutions, and not by us “little folks.”

However, because of the rise of the internet, online forex brokers are now able to offer trading accounts to “retail” traders like us.

Without further ado, here are the major forex market players:
1. The Super Banks

When it comes to forex trading, commercial banks and financial institutions are the movers and shakers.

Since the forex spot market is decentralized, it is the largest banks in the world that determine the exchange rates.

They’re responsible for most of the daily trading volume, and they make their money by acting as market makers.

This means they’re constantly buying and selling currencies, pocketing the difference between the bid and ask prices.

It’s a high-stakes game, but these banks have the deep pockets and expertise to play it.

These large banks, collectively known as the interbank market or Interdealer market, take on a ridonkulous amount of forex transactions each day for both their customers and themselves.

They are known as “flow monsters“.

Flow Monster

For these flow monsters, the name of the game is volume and capturing their share of the trading flow of currencies.

A couple of these flow monsters include Citi, JPMorgan, UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs,  HSBC, and Bank of America.

FX Banks
2. Electronic Liquidity Providers (ELPs)

Electronic Liquidity Providers (ELPs) are specialized firms that have grown to be major players in the foreign exchange (FX) market by using advanced technology and trading algorithms to provide liquidity to market participants.

Examples of ELPs are Citadel Securities, Flow Traders, HC Tech, Jump Trading, Virtu Financial, and XTX Markets.

They operate as intermediaries between buyers and sellers in the currency market, constantly quoting bid and ask prices for various currency pairs.

Their presence helps ensure that market participants can find counterparties for their trades, allowing for faster execution and reducing the potential impact of market volatility.
3. Large Commercial Companies

Companies take part in the foreign exchange market for the purpose of doing business.

For instance, Apple must first exchange its U.S. dollars for the Japanese yen when purchasing electronic parts from Japan for its products.

Since the volume they trade is much smaller than those in the interbank market, this type of market player typically deals with commercial banks for their transactions.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) between large companies can also create currency exchange rate fluctuations.

In international cross-border M&As, a lot of currency conversions happen that could move prices around.

Corporations might not be the most glamorous participants in the forex market, but they’re essential players nonetheless.

Companies that do business internationally need to buy and sell currencies to pay for goods and services, hedge their exposure to currency fluctuations, and manage their cash flow.

They may not be trading for profit, but their currency needs can still have a significant impact on the market.
4. Governments and Central Banks

Governments and central banks, such as the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Federal Reserve, are regularly involved in the forex market too.

Just like companies, national governments participate in the forex market for their operations, international trade payments, and handling their foreign exchange reserves.

Central banks are like the puppet masters of the forex market.

These big kahunas are responsible for implementing monetary policies that can move currency values.

They’re the ones who adjust interest rates and control the money supply.

By doing this, they can affect currency valuation.

There are also instances when central banks intervene, either directly or verbally, in the forex market when they want to realign exchange rates.

Sometimes, central banks think that their currency is priced too high or too low, so they start massive sell/buy operations to alter exchange rates.

When central banks make a move, everyone pays attention!
5. The Speculators

Currency speculation is the act of buying and holding foreign currency in the hopes of selling that currency at a higher exchange rate in the future.

This is in contrast to those who buy currencies to finance a foreign investment or to pay for imported products or services.

“In it to win it!”

This is probably the mantra of the speculators.

Speculation in the forex market involves the buying and selling of currencies with the view of making a profit.

Speculators are focused on price fluctuations.

It is called speculation because of the uncertainty involved since no one can know for sure whether a currency pair’s price will go up or down.

Traders assess the likelihood of either scenario before placing a trade.

Comprising close to 90% of all trading volume, speculators as forex market players come in all shapes and sizes.

Some have fat pockets, some roll thin, but all of them engage in the forex simply to make bucket loads of cash.

For this lesson, let’s narrow down speculators into two buckets:

    Hedge funds
    Retail traders

Hedge Funds and Prop Firms: The Smart Money

Hedge funds and prop firms are known as the “smart money” in the forex market.

These savvy traders use advanced strategies and advanced analytical tools to make educated bets on currency movements.

They’re not afraid to take risks, and they often employ leverage to make their bets even bigger.
Retail Traders: The Little Folks with Big Dreams

Last but not least, we have the retail traders – the little guys and gals with big dreams.

These are individual traders who trade currencies from their home computers, smartphones, or tablets.

They may not have the deep pockets or sophisticated tools of the big players, but they’re a growing force in the forex market, thanks to the proliferation of online trading platforms and educational resources.

Retail traders come in all shapes and sizes, from the casual hobbyist who dabbles in forex trading for fun to the aspiring professional who dreams of quitting their day job to trade full-time.

They may not move the market like the big players, but they’re an essential part of the forex ecosystem.

The forex market is a melting pot of participants, each with its own goals, strategies, and resources. From the powerful central banks to the humble retail traders, every player has a role to play in the global currency market

    title: " Know Your Retail Forex History! ",
    description:
        '''Once upon a time, foreign exchange (FX) trading was a stuffy affair, reserved for professionals and institutional investors

But then a wave of technological advancements swept in, and today, the market is globally accessible to individual traders.

Let’s take a lighthearted tour through the history of retail FX trading and see how we got from pocket protectors to mobile apps and beyond!
The Early Days: When FX Trading Was a Members-Only Club

Retail FX trading emerged in the groovy 1970s after the Bretton Woods system, which had pegged global currencies to the US dollar, was dismantled in 1971.

The resulting shift to a floating exchange rate system paved the way for increased currency speculation and the birth of the modern foreign exchange market.

Forex Exclusive Club

Unfortunately, back then, FX trading was like an exclusive club, with trading accessible only to banks, hedge funds, and large corporations.

Individual traders lacked access to the necessary resources and technology to participate in the market.

In other words, too small and too poor. 😢
The 1990s: Enter the Internet and a New Era of Retail FX Trading

Once the 1990s came along, thanks to computer nerds and the booming growth of the internet (cheers to you Mr. Al Gore), banks began creating their own trading platforms.

These platforms were designed to stream live quotes to their clients so that they could instantly execute trades themselves.

Meanwhile, some smart business-minded marketing machines introduced internet-based trading platforms for individual traders.

Known as “retail forex brokers“, these entities made it easy for individuals to trade by allowing smaller trade sizes.

Unlike in the interbank market where the standard trade size is one million units (or more), retail brokers allowed individuals to trade position sizes of as little as 1,000 units!

No longer was the market a members-only club; individual traders were now invited to the party!

Forex Brokers Popped Up Like MushroomsThe 1990s witnessed a significant turning point for retail FX trading, as the rapid development of the internet and personal computers enabled individual traders to access the currency market.

As internet speeds increased, online trading platforms popped up like mushrooms after a rainstorm, providing retail traders with user-friendly interfaces and access to market data, news, and analysis.
The Explosion of Online Forex Brokers and Trading Platforms

The early 2000s saw an explosion of online brokers, each eager to offer retail FX trading services. 💥

They wooed individual traders with promises of trading platforms, educational resources, and access to leverage – because who doesn’t love controlling larger positions with a smaller investment?

The increased competition among brokers led to tighter spreads, lower trading costs, and an expansion of trading products beyond major currency pairs.

Today, retail FX traders have access to a wide range of trading platforms, including MetaTrader 4 and 5, cTrader, and various proprietary platforms developed by individual brokers.

They even offer mobile apps so you can trade on your smartphone!

Forex Broker Platform

There’s something for everyone, whether you’re a charting connoisseur, a technical indicator aficionado, or an automated trading enthusiast
Regulatory Evolution and the Protection of Retail Traders

The growth of retail FX trading attracted the attention of financial regulators, who sought to protect individual traders from shady forex brokers and maintain market integrity.

The retail FX market was super shady back then! It was the Wild West! 🤠

They introduced strict rules and requirements for FX brokers, making sure they had enough capital, managed risk properly, and treated customers fairly.

Forex Regulatory Agency Like a Parent

It was like having a stern but loving parent watching over the market.

Prominent regulatory agencies in the retail FX industry include the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

These regulators have implemented measures such as leverage restrictions, negative balance protection, and mandatory segregation of customer funds to protect retail traders.
Summary

The history of retail FX trading is a colorful and exciting tale, filled with technological leaps, increasing accessibility, and ever-watchful regulatory guardians

From its humble beginnings in the 1970s to the present day, retail FX trading has transformed into a global phenomenon, offering individual traders the opportunity to participate in the world’s largest and most liquid financial market.

As technology continues to advance and regulations adapt, the future of retail FX trading promises to be even more fun and accessible for traders around the world.

    title: " Why Trade Forex: Advantages Of Forex Trading ",
    description: '''

There are many benefits and advantages of trading forex.

Here are just a few reasons why so many people are choosing this market:
No commissions

No clearing fees, no exchange fees, no government fees, no brokerage fees. Most retail forex brokers are compensated for their services through something called the “spread“.
No fixed lot size

In the futures markets, lot or contract sizes are determined by the exchanges. For example, a standard-sized contract for silver futures is 5,000 ounces.

In forex, you can trade smaller lot sizes, or position size. This allows traders to open trades as small as 1,000 units.

Low transaction costs

The retail transaction cost (the bid/ask spread) is typically less than 0.1% under normal market conditions.

For larger transactions, the spread could be as low as 0.07%. Of course, this depends on your leverage, and all that will be explained later.
A 24-hour market

There is no waiting for the opening bell. From the Monday morning opening in Australia to the Friday afternoon close in New York, the forex market never sleeps.

This is awesome for those who want to trade on a part-time basis because you can choose when you want to trade: morning, noon, night, during breakfast, or in your sleep.

No one can corner the market

The FX market is sufficiently liquid that significant manipulation by any single entity is all but impossible during active trading hours for the major currencies.

The foreign exchange market is so huge and has so many participants that no single entity (not even a central bank or the mighty Chuck Norris himself) can control the market price for an extended period of time.
Leverage

In forex trading, a small deposit can control a much larger total contract value. Leverage gives the trader the ability to make nice profits, and at the same time keep risk capital to a minimum.

For example, a forex broker may offer 50-to-1 leverage, which means that a   \$50 dollar margin deposit would enable a trader to buy or sell   \$2,500 worth of currencies. Similarly, with   \$500 dollars, one could trade with   \$25,000 dollars and so on.

While this is all gravy, let’s remember that leverage is a double-edged sword. Without proper risk management, this high degree of leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains.
Deep Liquidity

Because the forex market is so enormous, it is also extremely liquid. This is an advantage because it means that under normal market conditions, with a click of a mouse, you can instantaneously buy and sell at will.

You are never “stuck” in a trade. You can even set your online trading platform to automatically close your position once your desired profit level (a limit order) has been reached, and/or close a trade if a trade is going against you (a stop loss order).
Low Barriers to Entry

You would think that getting started as a currency trader would cost a ton of money. The fact is, when compared to trading stocks, options, or futures, it doesn’t.

Online forex brokers offer “mini” and “micro” trading accounts, some with a minimum account deposit of   \$50.

We are NOT saying you should open an account with the bare minimum, but it does make forex trading much more accessible to the average individual who doesn’t have a lot of start-up trading capital.
Free Stuff Everywhere!

Most online forex brokers offer “demo” accounts to practice trading and build your skills, along with real-time forex news and charting services.

And guess what?! They’re all free!

Demo accounts are very valuable resources for those who are “financially hampered” and would like to hone their trading skills with “play money” before opening a live trading account and risking real money.''',

    title: " Why Trade Forex: Forex vs. Stocks ",
    image: 'https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/pre-school-forex-vs-stocks.png',
    description: '''

There are approximately 2,400+ stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Another 3,900+ are listed on the NASDAQ.

Which one will you trade? Got the time to stay on top of so many companies?

With forex, there are dozens of currencies traded, but the majority of market players trade the seven major pairs.

Aren’t seven major pairs much easier to keep an eye on than thousands of stocks?

Forex vs. StocksLook at Mr. Forex. He’s so confident and sexy. Mr. Stocks has no chance!

That’s just one of the many advantages of the forex market over the stock markets. Here are a few more:
24-Hour Market

The stock market is limited to an exchange’s opening hours.

For example, in the U.S., most stock exchanges open at 9:30 am EST and close at 4:00 pm EST.

The forex market is a seamless 24-hour market.

Most brokers are open from Sunday at 5:00 pm EST until Friday at 5:00 pm EST, with customer service usually available 24/7.

With the ability to trade during the U.S., Asian, and European market hours, you can customize your own trading schedule.
Minimal or No Commissions

Thanks to Robinhood, a lot of online stock brokers now offer zero commissions, this is now less of a factor.

Most forex brokers charge no commission or additional transaction fees to trade currencies online or over the phone.

Combined with the tight, consistent, and fully transparent spread, forex trading costs are lower than those of any other market.

Most brokers are compensated for their services through the bid/ask spread.
Higher Trading Volume and Liquidity

The forex market sees an average daily turnover of   \$6.6 trillion.

The stock market sees a fraction of this.
Short-Selling without an Uptick

Unlike the equity market, there is no restriction on short selling in the currency market.

Trading opportunities exist in the currency market regardless of whether a trader is long OR short, or whichever way the market is moving.

Since currency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there is no directional bias to the market. So you always have equal access to trade in a rising or falling market.
Minimal Market Manipulation

How many times have you heard that “Fund A” was selling “X” or buying “Z”? The stock market is very susceptible to large fund buying and selling.

With currency trading, the massive size of the forex market makes the likelihood of any one fund or bank controlling a particular currency very small.

The FX market is sufficiently liquid that significant manipulation by any single entity is all but impossible during active trading hours for the major currencies.

Banks, hedge funds, governments, retail currency conversion houses, and large net worth individuals are just some of the participants in the spot currency markets where the liquidity is unprecedented.
Analysts and brokerage firms are less likely to influence the market

Have you watched TV lately?

Heard about a certain Internet stock and an analyst of a prestigious brokerage firm accused of keeping its recommendations, such as “buy,” when the stock was rapidly declining?

It is the nature of these relationships. No matter what the government does to step in and discourage this type of activity, we have not heard the last of it.

IPOs (and SPACs) are big business for both the companies going public and the brokerage houses.

Relationships are mutually beneficial and analysts work for the brokerage houses that need the companies as clients. That catch-22 will never disappear.

Foreign exchange, as the prime market, generates billions in revenue for the world’s banks and is a necessity of the global markets. Analysts in foreign exchange have very little effect on exchange rates; they just analyze the forex market.
Advantages 	Forex 	Stocks
24-Hour Trading 	YES 	No
Minimal or no commission 	YES 	Maybe
Liquidity 	HUGE 	Meh
Short-Selling without an Uptick 	YES 	No

In the battle between forex vs. stocks, it looks like the scorecard between Mr. Forex and Mr. Stocks shows a strong victory by Mr. Forex! Will it go for 2-0 with Mr. Futures?

    title: ' Why Trade Forex: Forex vs. Futures',
    description: '''

It’s not just the stock market. The forex market also boasts of a bunch of advantages over the futures market, similar to its advantages over stocks.

But wait, there’s more… So much more!
Liquidity
Forex vs. Futures

“Mr. Futures, our short shorts look cool!”

In the forex market,   \$6.6 trillion is traded daily, making it the largest and most liquid market in the world.

This market can absorb trading volume and transaction sizes that dwarf the capacity of any other market.

The futures market trades a puny   \$30 billion per day. Thirty billion? Peanuts!

The futures markets can’t compete with its relatively limited liquidity.

The forex market is always liquid, meaning positions can be liquidated and stop orders executed with little or no slippage, with exception to extremely volatile market conditions.
24-Hour Market

At 5:00 pm EST Sunday, trading begins as markets open in Sydney.

At 7:00 pm EST the Tokyo market opens, followed by London at 3:00 am EST.

And finally, New York opens at 8:00 am EST and closes at 4:00 p.m. EST.

Before New York trading closes, the Sydney market is back open – it’s a 24-hour seamless market!

As a trader, this allows you to react to favorable or unfavorable news by trading immediately.

If important data comes in from the United Kingdom or Japan while the U.S. futures market is closed, the next day’s opening could be a wild ride.

Overnight markets in futures contracts do exist, and while liquidity is improving, they are still thinly traded relative to the spot forex market.
Minimal or no commissions

With Electronic Communications Brokers becoming more popular and prevalent over the past couple of years, there is the chance that a broker may require you to pay commissions.

But really, the commission fees are peanuts compared to what you pay in the futures market.

The competition among spot forex brokers is so fierce that you will most likely get the best quotes and very low transaction costs.
Price Certainty

When trading forex, you get rapid execution and price certainty under normal market conditions. In contrast, the futures and equities markets do not offer price certainty or instant trade execution.

Even with the advent of electronic trading and limited guarantees of execution speed, the prices for fills for futures and equities on market orders are far from certain.

The prices quoted by brokers often represent the LAST trade, not necessarily the price for which the contract will be filled.
Guaranteed Limited Risk

Traders must have position limits for the purpose of risk management. This number is set relative to the money in a trader’s account.

Risk is minimized in the spot forex market because the online capabilities of the trading platform will automatically generate a margin call if the required margin amount exceeds the available trading capital in your account.

During normal market conditions, all open positions will be closed immediately (during fast market conditions, your position could be closed beyond your stop loss level).

In the futures market, your position may be liquidated at a loss bigger than what you had in your account, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in the account. That sucks.
Advantages 	Forex 	Futures
24-Hour Trading 	YES 	No
Minimal or no Commission 	YES 	No
Up to 500:1 Leverage 	YES 	No
Price Certainty 	YES 	No
Guaranteed Limited Risk 	YES 	No

Judging by the Forex vs. Futures Scorecard, Mr. Forex looks UNBEATABLE! Now meet the winners who trade the forex market.

          '''The biggest appeal that forex trading offers is the ability to trade on margin.

But for many forex traders, “margin” is a foreign concept and one that is often misunderstood.

Like Bob.Bob the Forex Trader

Bob sure knows his fried chicken and mashed potatoes but absolutely has no clue about margin and leverage.

Margin trading gives you the ability to enter into positions larger than your account balance.

With a little bit of cash, you can open a much bigger trade in the forex market.

And then with just a small change in price moving in your favor, you have the possibility of ending up with massively huge profits.

But for most new traders, because they usually don’t know what they’re doing, that’s not what usually happens.

More likely, price does move, but it moves against them.

Like what happened to Bob.

Bob was in a trade.

He was sure that this trade was going to be a winner so he bet BIG.

All of a sudden, to Bob’s surprise (and shock), he witnessed his trade being automatically closed on his trading platform and ended up suffering an epic loss.

The funds that now remain in Bob’s account aren’t even enough to open another trade.

Bob is confused. He asks himself, “WTF just happened?”Bob Gets A Margin Call

He contacts his forex broker and is told that he had been “sent a Margin Call and experienced a Stop Out“.

Bob doesn’t know what the broker is talking about.

Bob is CLUELESS.

This is why understanding how margin works is essential.

A lot of new traders do not understand the concept of margin, how it’s used, how to calculate it, and the significance that it plays in their trading.

Do you know what margin actually is? What about used margin?

What is free margin? What is margin level? What is a margin call? What is a stop out or margin closeout?

As you can see, there is A LOT of “margin jargon” used in forex trading.

Before you choose a forex broker and begin trading with margin, it’s important to understand what all this margin jargon means.

If you don’t, it’s almost guaranteed that you will end up like Bob.

Terrible things will happen to your trading account like a margin call or a stop out. But you won’t even know what just happened or even why it happened.

If you really want to understand how margin is used in forex trading, you need to know how your margin trading account really works.

This starts with understanding what the heck some (really important) numbers you see on your trading platform really mean.

We’ll call these numbers your margin account’s “metrics”.

For example, take a look at the MetaTrader 4, also known as MT4, trading platform:

MetaTrader Account Metrics

The metrics above are all intertwined.

A change in one causes a change in another.Margin Relationships As a trader, you need to be aware of the relationships between them…

BEFORE ever entering a single trade on a live account.

Don’t be like Bob.

Don't Be Bob

Where certain metrics fall below a certain value, BAD THINGS will happen!

So you need to know what these metrics are!

You also need to know what these “bad things” are!

Make sure you have a solid grasp of how your trading account actually works and how it uses margin.

So let’s dive right in.

A margin trading account displays the following metrics:

    Balance
    Used Margin
    Free Margin
    Unrealized P/L
    Equity
    Margin Level

A metric is just a measurement of “something”.

This means that every metric above measures something important about your account involving margin.

For example, the “Balance” measures how much cash you have in your account. And if you don’t have a certain amount of cash, you may not have enough “margin” to open new trades or keep existing trades open.

Depending on the trading platform, each metric might have slightly different names but what’s being measured is the same.

Let’s take another look at the metrics on MetaTrader 4.

MetaTrader4 Metrics

You’ll notice that it looks like that “Used Margin” is not displayed. But it’s there. MetaTrader 4 just displays it as “Margin”.Y U do dis?
Here’s another example of account metrics from a different forex trading platform:

Forex Margin Metrics

Same metrics as MetaTrader 4, but different labels.

Don’t worry about the different labels right now, we’ll explain each margin-related metric in a way that you’ll be able to know which metric is which regardless of the exact label.

    title: 'What is Account Balance?',
    image: 'https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/16201717/swap-example-768x277.png',
    description: '''What does “Account Balance” mean?

In order to start trading forex, you need to open an account with a retail forex broker or CFD provider.

Once your account is approved, then you can transfer funds into the account.

This new account should only be funded with “risk capital”, which is cash you can afford to lose.Risk Capital

The “Account Balance” or simply “Balance” is the starting balance of your account.

Basically, it’s the amount of CASH in your account.

Cash in Trading Account

Think of it this way:

Balance = Cash

Your Balance measures the amount of cash you have in your trading account.

If you deposit   \$1,000, then your Balance is   \$1,000.

Account Balance Deposit

If you enter a new trade or in trader lingo, “open a new position”, your account balance is not affected until the position is CLOSED.

This means that your Balance will only change in one of three ways:

    When you add more funds to your account.
    When you close a position.
    When you keep a position open overnight and either receive or pay swap/rollover fee.

Since the topic is about margin, the concepts of swap and rollover aren’t really related but for thoroughness, we’ll quickly describe it since swap fees do affect your Balance.

Just know that there’s a difference between a trade that lasts a couple of hours and a trade you keep open overnight.

rollover

The procedure of moving open positions from one trading day to another is called a rollover.

Most brokers perform the rollover automatically by closing any open positions at the end of the day, while simultaneously opening an identical position for the following business day.

During this rollover, a swap is calculated.

A swap is a FEE that is either paid or charged to you at the end of each trading day if you keep your trade open overnight.

If you are paid swap, cash will be added to your Balance.

If you are charged swap, cash will be deducted from your Balance.

Unless you’re trading huge position sizes, these swap fees are usually small but can add up over time.

In MetaTrader, you can see swaps on your open position (if you keep it open for longer than 1 day) by opening a “Terminal” window and clicking on the “Trade” tab.

Swap in Forex

The concept of swap and rollover is beyond the scope of this lesson and will not be discussed further, but we just wanted to cover if briefly for accuracy’s sake.

    title: ' What is Unrealized P/L and Floating P/L? ',
    image:
        'https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13154601/floating-profit-and-balance.png',
    description: '''

In your trading platform, you will see something that says “Unrealized P/L” or “Floating P/L” with green or red numbers beside them.

In this lesson, we explain what Unrealized P/L and Floating P/L are.

When trading, there are actually two different types of “profit or loss”, also known as “P/L”.

Both are important. Let’s discuss the difference between the two.
Unrealized P/L

Unrealized P/L refers to the profit or loss held in your current open positions….your currently active trades.

This is equal to the profit or loss that would be “realized” if all your open positions were closed immediately.

Unrealized P/L is also known as “Floating P/L” because the value is constantly changing since your positions are still open.

Floating Profit and Loss

Your unrealized P/L continuously fluctuates (or “floats”) with the current market prices if you have open positions.

For example, if you currently have an unrealized profit, if price move against you, the unrealized profit can become an unrealized loss.
Example: Floating Loss

Let’s say your account is in USD and you are currently long 10,000 units EUR/USD, which was bought at 1.15000.

The current exchange rate for EUR/USD is 1.13000.

Let’s calculate the position’s Floating P/L:

Floating P/L = Position Size x (Current Price - Entry Price)

Floating P/L = 10,000 x (1.13000 - 1.15000) 

-200 = 10,000 x (- 0.0200)

The position is down 200 pips.

Since you’re trading a mini lot, each pip is worth  \$1.

So you currently have a Floating Loss of  \$200 (200 pips x  \$1).

Floating Loss Example

It is a Floating Loss because you have NOT closed the trade yet.

Usually, when a loss remains floating, you are hoping that the price will turn around.

If EUR/USD rose above your original entry price to 1.16000, then you would now have a Floating Profit.

The position is now up 100 pips.

Since you’re trading a mini lot, each pip is worth  \$1.

So you currently have a Floating Profit of  \$100 (100 pips x  \$1).

Floating Profit Example
Realized P/L

A Realized Profit is profit that comes from a completed trade.

Same thing with a loss.

A Realized Loss is a loss that comes from a completed trade.

In other words, your profits or losses only become realized when the positions are CLOSED.

This is the only time when your account balance will change to reflect any gains or losses.

If you closed a position with profits, your account balance will increase. If you closed with losses, then your account balance will decrease.
Example: Realized Loss

Let’s say your account is in USD and you are currently long 10,000 units of EUR/USD, which was bought at 1.15000.

The current exchange rate for EUR/USD is 1.13000.

Let’s calculate the position’s Floating P/L:

Floating P/L = Position Size x (Current Price - Entry Price)

Floating P/L = 10,000 x (1.13000 - 1.15000) 

-200 = 10,000 x (- 0.0200)

The position is down 200 pips.

And since you’re trading a mini lot, each pip is worth  \$1.

So you currently have a Floating Loss of  \$200 (200 pips x  \$1).Floating Loss Example

It is a floating loss because you have NOT closed the trade yet.

But you can’t stomach losing anymore and decide to close the trade right then and there.Realized Loss Example You’ve realized the  \$200 loss and the cash is DEDUCTED from your account balance.

When you opened the trade, you had  \$1,000 as your Balance.

But after you closed the trade with a  \$200 loss, your Balance is now  \$800.
	Balance 	Floating P/L
BEFORE   \$1,000 	  \$200
AFTER   \$800 	–
Example: Realized Profit

Let’s say your account is in USD and you are currently long 10,000 units of EUR/USD, which was bought at 1.15000

The current exchange rate for EUR/USD is 1.16000.

Let’s calculate the position’s Floating P/L:

Floating P/L = Position Size x (Current Price - Entry Price)

Floating P/L = 10,000 x (1.16000 - 1.15000) 

100 = 10,000 x (0.0100)

The position is up 100 pips.

And since you’re trading a mini lot, each pip is worth  \$1.

So you currently have a Floating Profit of  \$100 (100 pips x  \$1).Floating Profit Example It is a floating profit because you have NOT closed the trade yet.

You hear a voice out of nowhere to exit your trade.

So you close the trade.

You’ve realized the   \$100 gain and the cash is ADDED to your account balance.

When you opened the trade, you had   \$1,000 as your Balance.

But after you closed the trade with a   \$100 gain, your Balance is now   \$1,100.
	Balance 	Floating P/L
BEFORE 	  \$1,000 	+  \$100
AFTER 	  \$1,100 	–
Profit Isn’t Real Until It’s Realized

The difference between realized and unrealized profit is subtle, but it can mean the difference between a profitable trade or a losing trade.

It is important for traders to clearly know how to differentiate between “realized” P/L and “unrealized” P/L

    Realized profits are gains that have been converted into cash and ADDED to your account balance.
    Realized losses are losses that have been converted into cash and DEDUCTED from your account balance.

In other words, for you to realize profits from a trade you’ve made, you must receive cash and not simply observe the value of your trade increase without exiting the trade.

Unrealized profit is theoretical profit or “paper profit” that is currently available, but could be taken away at any moment if the price moves against the trade.

When it comes to love, think about “the one” that got away.

At one point in your life, he or she was an “unrealized” spouse.

Forex Love

You never built up the courage to pop the question and now you’re forever heartbroken with a “realized” loss of the perfect spouse.

This is exactly what happened to Bob.

Bob the Forex Trader

To this day, Bob is still single.

This depressing life lesson from Bob’s sad love story can be applied to trading.

If you have not closed out of your position and “realized” your gain, you could still lose some, or all, of your profits.

Realized profit is real profit that can no longer be affected by price changes because it is no longer part of an active trade.

It is real money that is added to your Balance and can be withdrawn from your trading account and transferred into your bank account.
Recap

In this lesson, we learned about the following:

    Unrealized P/L or Floating P/L refers to the profit or loss held in your current open positions….your currently active trades.
    Realized P/L refers to profit or loss from a completed trade.

    description: '''What is margin?

When trading forex, you are only required to put up a small amount of capital to open and maintain a new position.

This capital is known as the margin.

For example, if you want to buy \$100,000 worth of USD/JPY, you don’t need to put up the full amount, you only need to put up a portion, like \$3,000. The actual amount depends on your forex broker or CFD provider.

Margin can be thought of as a good faith deposit or collateral that’s needed to open a position and keep it open.

It is a “good faith” assurance that you can afford to hold the trade until it is closed.

Margin is NOT a fee or a transaction cost.

Margin is simply a portion of your funds that your forex broker sets aside from your account balance to keep your trade open and to ensure that you can cover the potential loss of the trade.

Required Margin

This portion is “used” or “locked up” for the duration of the specific trade.

Once the trade is closed, the margin is “freed” or “released” back into your account and can now be “usable” again… to open new trades.
What is Margin Requirement?

Margin is expressed as a percentage (%) of the “full position size”, also known as the “Notional Value” of the position you wish to open.

Depending on the currency pair and forex broker, the amount of margin required to open a position VARIES.

You may see margin requirements such as 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10% or higher.

This percentage (%) is known as the Margin Requirement.

Here are some examples of margin requirements for several currency pairs:
Currency Pair 	Margin Requirement
EUR/USD 	2%
GBP/USD 	5%
USD/JPY 	4%
EUR/AUD 	3%
What is Required Margin?

When margin is expressed as a specific amount of your account’s currency, this amount is known as the Required Margin.

EACH position you open will have its own Required Margin amount that will need to be “locked up”.

    Required Margin is also known as Deposit Margin, Entry Margin, or Initial Margin.

Let’s look at a typical EUR/USD (euro against U.S. dollar) trade. To buy or sell a 100,000 of EUR/USD without leverage would require the trader to put up \$100,000 in account funds, the full value of the position.

But with a Margin Requirement of 2%, only \$2,000 (the “Required Margin“) of the trader’s funds would be required to open and maintain that \$100,000 EUR/USD position.

2% Margin Requirement
Example #1: Open a long USD/JPY position

Let’s say you’ve deposited \$1,000 in your account and want to go long USD/JPY and want to open 1 mini lot (10,000 units) position.

How much margin will you need to open this position?

USDJPY Required Margin Example

Since USD is the base currency. this mini lot is 10,000 dollars, which means the position’s Notional Value is \$10,000.

Assuming your trading account is denominated in USD, since the Margin Requirement is 4%, the Required Margin will be \$400.

Required Margin Example
Example #2: Open a long GBP/USD position

Let’s say you’ve deposited \$1,000 in your account and want to go long GBP/USD at 1.30000 and want to open 1 mini lot (10,000 units) position.

How much margin will you need to open this position?

Since GBP is the base currency, this mini lot is 10,000 pounds, which means the position’s Notional Value is \$13,000.

Assuming your trading account is denominated in USD, since the Margin Requirement is 5%, the Required Margin will be \$650.

Required Margin Example w/ GBPUSD
Example #3: Open a long EUR/AUD position

Let’s say you want to go long EUR/AUD and want to open 1 mini lot (10,000 units) position.

How much margin will you need to open this position?

EURAUD Required Margin Example

Assuming your trading account is denominated in USD, you need to first know what the EUR/USD price. Let’s say EUR/USD is trading at 1.15000.

Since EUR is the base currency, this mini lot is 10,000 euros, which means the position’s Notional Value is \$11,500.

Since the Margin Requirement is 3%, the Required Margin will be \$345.

Required Margin Example w/ EURAUD
How to Calculate Required Margin

When trading with margin, the amount of margin (“Required Margin”) needed to hold open a position is calculated as a percentage (“Margin Requirement”) of the position size (“Notional Value”).

The specific amount of Required Margin is calculated according to the base currency of the currency pair traded.

If the base currency is DIFFERENT from your trading account’s currency, the Required Margin is then converted to your account denomination.

Here is the formula to calculate the Required Margin:

If the base currency is the SAME as your account’s currency:

Required Margin = Notional Value x Margin Requirement

If the base currency is DIFFERENT from your account’s currency:

Required Margin = Notional Value x Margin Requirement
x Exchange Rate Between Base Currency and Account Currency

The only reason for having funds in your account is to make sure you have enough margin to use for trading.

When it comes to trading forex, your ability to open trades is not necessarily based on the funds in your account balance. More accurately, it’s based on the amount of margin you have.

This means that your broker is always looking to see if you have enough margin in your account, which can actually differ from your account balance.

If this sounds confusing, don’t you worry.  It’ll start to make more sense as we proceed.
